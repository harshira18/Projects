The following two open-source benchmark datasets were used to assess the performance and accuracy of the text detection models:

The ICDAR 2013 dataset has an emphasis on text content retrieval from images captured as born-digital files, such as those transferred over email and the internet. 462 pictures in total—229 for training and 233 for the test set—make up the ICDAR 2013 dataset. The challenges associated with text extraction from born-digital images include localisation, segmentation and recognition of text.

ICDAR 2015 is a new incidental scene text dataset that focuses on scene texts and video texts (Horizontal and multi-oriented) and is introduced for text detection alongside born-digital pictures. 1500 pictures in total, 1000 for training and 500 for the test set, make up the ICDAR 2015 dataset.

Some sample training and testing images have been provided for both IC-13 and IC-15 datasets in this repository. You can visit the above links to view or download the complete datasets.
